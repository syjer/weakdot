TODO:
-----
0: as a default, hide the "edit mode" button in the presentation.
1: save/load slides gui for localstorage is quite messy!
2: use history api for creating nice url for saving the state
3: export to imgur, export to file, import from imgur, import from other github urls (gist, raw url)

misc:

- when exiting the slide mode, the current slide should be the one focused in the preview mode.
- tweak align/css on the top menu/ {hide/show {load template/load from/etc...}}
